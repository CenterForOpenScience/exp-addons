  This interface allows you to specify which OSF accounts are allowed to access this site. To get the id for an OSF user, visit <a target="_blank" href={{concat osfURL 'search/'}}>the OSF search page</a>, search for the user you are looking for by name, and click the link that corresponds with that person. From that page, look in the URL and grab the 5-6 character id from that url. E.g. for {{concat osfURL 'ab34rt/'}} the user id is 'ab34rt'.

  Alternatively, ask that user to log into the OSF and visit his or her <a href={{concat osfURL 'profile/'}}> profile page</a> and to copy the user id from the 'Public Profile' link.
