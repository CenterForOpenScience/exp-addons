        <p>We'll be analyzing where your child chooses to look during the videos--but only if we can tell where that is! Please check each of the following to ensure we're able to use your video:</p>

        <ol>
            <hr>
            <img class="example" src="assets/centering.png">
            <li><span class='exp-physics-config-quality-summary'>Make sure the webcam you're using is roughly centered</span> relative to this monitor. This makes it much easier for us to tell whether your child is looking to the left or right!</li>

            <hr>
            <img class="example" src="assets/monitors.png">
            <li><span class='exp-physics-config-quality-summary'>Turn off any other monitors</span> connected to your computer, besides the one with the centered webcam. (If there's just one monitor, you're all set!)</li>

             <hr>
             <img class="example" src="assets/distractions.png">
            <li>If it's practical, <span class='exp-physics-config-quality-summary'>minimize exciting things</span> that are visible behind or to the side of the screen--for instance, by facing a wall instead of the kitchen. (If this isn't practical for you, don't worry about it!) </li>

             <hr>
            <img class="example" src="assets/lighting.png">
            <li> Make sure you can <span class='exp-physics-config-quality-summary'>clearly see your own eyes</span> on the webcam view to the right. You may need to either turn on a light or reduce backlighting (e.g. by closing a window curtain behind you).</li>
