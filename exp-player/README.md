# Exp-player

An Ember addon for the Experimenter player. This repo will eventually include:

- the core exp-player component
- exp- components to be used with the player
      
## Frame development

This addon includes blueprints for creating frames. If you want to create a frame in the shared addon project use:

`ember g addon-exp-frame exp-<name>`

otherwise to generate a project-specific frame use:

`ember g exp-frame exp-<name>`

which will create a new component and corresponding template for the new frame.
